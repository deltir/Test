<p>HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language.<br>
The < ! DOCTYPE html > declaration defines that this document is an HTML5 document.<br>
The < html > < / html > element is the root element of an HTML page.<br>
The < head > < / head > element contains meta information about the HTML page.<br>
The < title > < / title > element specifies a title for the HTML page (which is shown in the browser's title bar or in the page's tab).<br>
The < body > < / body > element defines the document's body, and is a container for all the visible contents, such as headings, images, tables, lists, etc.</p>
<h1>The < h1 > < / h1 > element defines the largest heading, like this line.</h1>
<h2>This is an < h2 > < / h2 > element.</h2>
<h3>This is an < h3 > < / h3 > element.</h3>
<h4>This is an < h4 > < / h4 > element.</h4>
<h5>This is an < h5 > < / h5 > element.</h5>
<h6>The < h6 > < / h6 > element defines the smallest heading, like this line.</h6>
<p>The < p > < / p > element defines a paragraph, like this line.<br>
An element is made up of an opening tag (written as < >) and a closing tag (written as < / >).<br>
These<br>are<br>examples<br>of<br>the<br>line<br>break<br>tag<br>(written as < br >),<br>which are all written within a paragraph element in this instance.<br>
HTML links are defined by the < a > element (written as < a href = " https://www.websitename.com " > Anything between these tags will be linked text < / a >). See how this is no longer linked text?<br>
The link's destination is specified in the href attribute. Attributes are used to provide additional information about HTML elements.<br>
HTML images are defined by the < img > tag (written as < img src = "imagefrommatrixfilename.wpg" alt = "Scene from Matrix" width = "100" length = "200" >)<br>
The source file (src), alternative text (alt), width, and height are provided as attributes (like href = "" in < a > < / a > elements!)<br>
